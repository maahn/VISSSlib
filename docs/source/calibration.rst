Calibrate instruments

Calibrate Level 1 data
----------------------

Level 1 data is still in pixel units, in case calibrated data is required, divide 
the quantities in pixels (Dmax, perimeter, etc.) by config.calibration.slope and
the quantities in pixels^2 (area) by config.calibration.slope^2


Calibrate Level 2 data

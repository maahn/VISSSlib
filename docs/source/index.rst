   a) Concept drawing of the VISSS (not to scale with enlarged
   observation volume). See Sections `2.2 <#sec:matching>`__ and
   `2.3 <#sec:rotation>`__ for a discussion of the joint coordinate
   system and the transformation of the follower’s coordinate system,
   respectively. b) First generation VISSS deployed at Gothic, Colorado
   during the SAIL campaign (Photo by Benn Schmatz), c) Randomly
   selected particles observed during MOSAiC on 15 November 2019 between
